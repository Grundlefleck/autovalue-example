===================

Trying out Google's Auto library https://github.com/google/auto

The goal of this project is to test and show how AutoValue would be used in a real project. That includes:

 1. Compiling and testing from the command line, with:
  1. Maven - Done
  2. Gradle
 2. Editing and working on code in popular IDEs, including:
  1. Eclipse
  2. IntelliJ IDEA
 3. Working on the projects with most popular JDK versions:
  1. 1.6
  2. 1.7
  3. 1.8
 4. Depending on an AutoValue-based project, via:
  1. JAR dependency
  2. multi-module build in various build tools (?)
